# Advanced-Object-Detection-Model

Step 1. Clone this repository

Step 2. Create a new virtual environment

Step 3. Activate your virtual environment

Step 4. Install dependencies and add virtual environment to the Python Kernel

Step 5. Collect images 

Step 6. Begin training process 

Step 7. During this process the Jupyter Notebook will install Tensorflow Object Detection.

Step 8. Once you get to step 6. Train the model, inside of the notebook, you may choose to train the model from within the notebook. 

Step 9. You can optionally evaluate your model inside of Tensorboard. Once the model has been trained and you have run the evaluation command under Step 7. Navigate to the evaluation folder for your trained model
